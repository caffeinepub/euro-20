  "summary": "The diff implements a browser-safe `process.env` shim and adds UI-visible error messaging for authentication and streak-related operations, but it does not show any concrete fix for the underlying Internet Computer build/deploy failure (no backend/config changes are evidenced). It also introduces some UI/behavior changes not explicitly requested (e.g., footer link construction and toast messaging changes).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Identify the exact build/deploy failure causing the deployment error and fix the root cause so the project builds and deploys successfully on the Internet Computer.",
      "reason": "The diff contains only frontend code changes (shims, UI components, query/mutation error handling). There is no evidence of changes to backend canister code, dfx configuration, build tooling, or any other deploy-related root-cause fix or identification.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add a minimal, user-facing error surface for failed authentication/actor initialization and failed streak mutations so errors are visible in the UI in English.",
      "reason": "Authentication errors and streak mutation/load errors appear to be surfaced (AuthErrorBanner, inline errors, toasts), but there is no clear evidence of a user-facing error surface specifically for actor initialization/creation failures (e.g., `useActor` failures), beyond what is shown for streak queries/mutations.",
