  "summary": "Diff implements CEFR level definitions, level-aware lesson content lookup, a visible level selector in LanguageLearningPage, and flag rendering in HomePage and LanguageSwitcher using centralized language metadata. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the required 20 flag image assets were added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and the lessonsSeed.ts content is truncated so full coverage of all 20 languages × 6 levels × 5 sections cannot be verified from the provided diff.",

      "requirement": "Update the seeded lesson dataset to include CEFR levels for all 20 supported languages, using current content as A1 and providing valid content entries for A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2 for every language and section.",
      "reason": "lessonsSeed.ts is shown only in truncated form and only demonstrates A1 content for English plus placeholder structures; there is no diff evidence confirming that every language code in languages.ts has entries for A1–C2 and that every section resolves for every (language, level).",

      "requirement": "Add a country flag static asset for each of the 20 supported languages under frontend/public/assets/generated and display the flags in the home language grid and language switcher; do not serve flags via backend.",
      "reason": "UI changes to render flags are present, but the diff summary includes no added/modified files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the existence of the 20 required bundled flag images cannot be confirmed from the provided diff.",
